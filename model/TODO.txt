TODOs:

Model:
Model associationEnd role names witch are missing for reading xmi (e.g. ModelElement.comment)
Fix ungeneratable constructs (playedRole in LinkObject)
Add OCL constraints


Generation:
DONE Generate correct cardinalities for associations and attributes
DONE Generate correct type for Attributes, *KindType for enums and "some" DataTypes (Name),
	Elements and ElementRefs for other DataTypes (Multiplicity, Expression, ...)
DONE Generate Marshalling/Unmarshalling without Castor (xstream?), because of the Enumeration problem

* Dragging Elements with an AssociationClass to a ClassDiagram
* Dragging of AssociationClasses to a ClassDiagram
* FIXED TaggedValue "Derived" not visible in ClassDiagram
* OrderingKind on AssociationEnds not visible in ClassDiagram ({ordered})
* Constraints on Associations not possible ({xor})
* (Constraints on Generalisations? Haven't checked)


AssociationClass Bugs:

There are some bugs regarding the visualistion of AssociationClasses in ClassDiagrams.
It is possible to create AssociationClasses in a ClassDiagram and the rendering is ok.
But it's impossible to get a correct rendering by dragging classes to a new ClassDiagram.
If you drag the AssociationClass to the diagram it gets rendered as a AssociationClass
connected to a n-ary Association. And if you drag the Elements connected by the
AssociationClass to the diagram, the AssociationClass is rendered as a normal Association.


Derived not visible in ClassDiagrams
FIXED Derived Attributes and Associations are not shown with a '/' in front of the name in ClassDiagrams.


Ordering is not shown in the ClassDiagram
If I select 'ordered' on an AssociationEnd, i'd like to see a '{ordered}'-label (maybe configurable) in the ClassDiagram.


Constraints on Associations and Generalizations
I've found no way to express Constraints like {xor} or {distinct} on Associations and Generalizations in ClassDiagrams (and in the model).
