MDDGenerator
============

Description
-----------
The MDD Generator Framework is the current java implementation of an
UML based code generator framework based on the Soulspace Template
Engine.

The MDAGenerator repository now contains the modules (eclipse projects)
 * ArgoUMLProfileLibrary
 * UML14Repository
 * UML14ModelBuilder
 * MDDRepository
 * MDDGenerator
 * MDDTemplateLibrary

Each of the modules has a separate README file which explains the
modules purpose. The modules can be built either with Baumeister or
GlobalBuild at the moment.

Documentation
-------------
You can find the generator usage documentation in the doc directory of the
MDDGenerator module. The documentation of the template language can be
found in directory TemplateEngine/doc in the TemplateEngine repository.

Notes
-----
 * The preexisting single module repositories have now been merged into one
   MDDGenerator repository.
